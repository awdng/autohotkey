autohotkey
==========

AutoHotkey config files i use to emulate mac keymaps on PCs.

As a PC/Windows and Mac/OSX user the different key maps always were a pain for me when swichting between systems for coding.
The mental overhead to switch from one layout to the other felt very inefficient to me, yet all of the solutions i found (like KeyRemap4MacBook or just switching function keys in OSX) had small annoyances.
I realized that i actually like the default keymap of OSX for coding (for one because you don't need to use Home/End Keys which are in awkward positions on many modern laptops or compact keyboards).

I then discovered that AutoHotkey is a pretty powerful tool which can also be used to remap the keymap and found some AutoHotkey files that did exactly this. All of those i found tried to get the native MAC keyboards to work right on Windows, but i wanted to get my mechanical keyboard work the same way on Windows like it did on OSX.

So i grabbed those (can't find the forum link right now) and modified them to emulate a standard MAC keymap on a standard PC keyboard (us qwerty layout).

This is a first version and by no means perfect, but seems to work pretty well for my needs, YMMV. Feel free to do whatever you want with it, i'd be happy to accept pull requests to make it better for all people with similar problems.

Tested on Windows 8.1 Pro only.
